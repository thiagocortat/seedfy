# npm resolution error report

While resolving: corpo-app@1.0.0
Found: react@19.1.0
node_modules/react
  react@"19.1.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^16.5.1 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0" from lucide-react-native@0.363.0
node_modules/lucide-react-native
  lucide-react-native@"^0.363.0" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
